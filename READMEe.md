## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I've learnt a lot more about setting up my html structure and css styling with respect to how i intend to manipulate and transverse the DOM, i've also understood more about Arrays and array methods like map, filter, find, forEach and reduce and how to use them to properly and dynamically display data in the DOM/browser. Finally, i've improved my error handling skills and how to locate and fix bugs. 

### Continued development

Base on my recent and current development, I'm hoping to be more grounded in javascript logics and problem solving with already available tools.
Looking forward to getting more comfortble with more array methods and also asynchronous javascript.

### Useful resources

Reading up on concepts and methods on the MDN documentation, W3school and stack overflow help me understand many key concepts that needed to be understood. videos from youtube about various javascript topics were also immensly helpful.
